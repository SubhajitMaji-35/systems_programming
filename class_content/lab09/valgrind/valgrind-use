valgrind ./4


definitely lost: your program is leaking memory and you need to fix it!
indirectly lost: your program may have crashed and couldn’t clean up memory.
suppressed: you can safely ignore this area since this memory was not managed by your program
possibly lost: your program is leaking memory unless you’re doing odd things with pointers.
